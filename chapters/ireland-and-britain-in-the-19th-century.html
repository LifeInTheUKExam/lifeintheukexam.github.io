About <strong>two-thirds of people</strong> worked in farming, often on very <strong>small plots of land</strong>. Many depended mainly on <strong>potatoes</strong> for food.<br> In the <strong>mid-19th century</strong>, the <strong>potato crop failed</strong>, causing a <strong>terrible famine</strong>. Around <strong>one million people</strong> died from disease and hunger. Another <strong>one and a half million</strong> left Ireland — some moved to the <strong>United States</strong>, others to <strong>England</strong>.<br> By <strong>1861</strong>, many Irish people lived in <strong>Liverpool, London, Manchester</strong>, and <strong>Glasgow</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>Irish Nationalist movement</strong> grew stronger during this time.</p> <ul> <li>Groups like the <strong>Fenians</strong> wanted full <strong>independence</strong> from Britain.</li> <li>Others, like <strong>Charles Stuart Parnell</strong>, wanted <strong>Home Rule</strong>, meaning Ireland would stay in the UK but have its <strong>own parliament</strong>.</li> </ul> <div class="knowledge_card"> <h4>The Union Flag (or Union Jack)</h4> <div style="margin-top: 5px;"> <div> For many years, Ireland was a separate country from England and Wales. They only shared the same monarch starting with Henry VIII. This changed in 1801. Ireland was unified with England, Scotland, and Wales. This happened after the Act of Union of 1800. This union created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. </div> <div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <strong>The Flag's Design and Name</strong><br> One symbol of this new union was a new official flag: the Union Flag. It is also often called the Union Jack. The flag is a combination of the crosses linked to England, Scotland, and Ireland. The Union Flag is still the official flag of the UK today. </div> <div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <strong>The Three Crosses</strong><br> The Union Flag is made up of three distinct crosses: <ul> <li>St George's Cross 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: This represents England. It is a red cross on a white background. St George is the patron saint of England.</li> <li>St Andrew's Cross 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: This represents Scotland. It is a diagonal white cross on a blue background. St Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland.</li> <li>St Patrick's Cross 🇮🇪: This represents Ireland. It is a diagonal red cross on a white background. St Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/union-jack-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/union-jack-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/union-jack-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/union-jack.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Union Flag (or Union Jack) <div class="source">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> </div> </div> The <strong>Welsh flag</strong> does not appear on the Union Flag because, when the initial Union Jack was created in 1606 <strong>Wales was already united with England</strong>. <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/welsh-flag-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/welsh-flag-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/welsh-flag-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/welsh-flag.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Flag of Wales <div class="source">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Wales" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="the-right-to-vote">The Right to Vote</h2> <p>As towns and cities became wealthier and more powerful, the <strong>middle classes</strong> wanted more <strong>political rights</strong>.<br> The <strong>Reform Act of 1832</strong> expanded the <strong>right to vote</strong> and ended the old <strong>pocket</strong> and <strong>rotten boroughs</strong>. It gave more <strong>parliamentary seats</strong> to towns and cities, shifting power from the countryside.<br> However, <strong>only property owners</strong> could vote, so most <strong>working-class people</strong> could not.</p> <p>A new movement, the <strong>Chartists</strong>, campaigned for voting rights for <strong>working-class men</strong> and people <strong>without property</strong>. They sent <strong>petitions</strong> to <strong>Parliament</strong>, but at first, they failed.<br> The <strong>Reform Act of 1867</strong> gave more <strong>urban seats</strong> and reduced property requirements, yet most men — and <strong>all women</strong> — still could not vote.</p> <p>As the number of voters grew, <strong>political parties</strong> started reaching out to <strong>ordinary citizens</strong> to win elections.<br> Later, in the <strong>20th century</strong>, <strong>universal suffrage</strong> — the right of <strong>all adults</strong>, men and women, to vote — was finally achieved.</p> <h3 id="womens-rights-and-the-suffragettes">Women’s Rights and the Suffragettes</h3> <p>In the <strong>19th century</strong>, women in Britain had <strong>fewer rights</strong> than men.<br> Before <strong>1870</strong>, when a woman married, her <strong>money, property, and earnings</strong> automatically became her <strong>husband’s</strong>.<br> The <strong>Acts of Parliament</strong> in <strong>1870</strong> and <strong>1882</strong> changed this, allowing wives to <strong>keep their own property and earnings</strong>.</p> <p>In the <strong>late 19th</strong> and <strong>early 20th centuries</strong>, more women <strong>protested</strong> for equal rights — especially for the <strong>right to vote</strong>.<br> They formed the <strong>women’s suffrage movement</strong>, and were known as <strong>suffragettes</strong>.</p> <div class="knowledge_card"> <h4>Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928)</h4> <div style="margin-top: 5px;"> <strong>Emmeline Pankhurst</strong> was born in <strong>Manchester</strong> in <strong>1858</strong>. In <strong>1889</strong>, she created the <strong>Women’s Franchise League</strong>, which fought for <strong>married women’s right to vote</strong> in <strong>local elections</strong>.<br> Later, in <strong>1903</strong>, she helped found the <strong>Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU)</strong> — the first group whose members were called <strong>suffragettes</strong>.<br> The WSPU used <strong>civil disobedience</strong> to demand voting rights for women. They <strong>chained themselves to railings</strong>, <strong>smashed windows</strong>, and even <strong>committed arson</strong>. Many, including <strong>Pankhurst</strong>, went on <strong>hunger strike</strong>.<br> In <strong>1918</strong>, women over <strong>30</strong> gained the right to <strong>vote</strong> and <strong>stand for Parliament</strong>, partly for their work during <strong>World War I</strong>.<br> Just before Pankhurst’s death in <strong>1928</strong>, the voting age for women was lowered to <strong>21</strong>, making it <strong>equal to men’s</strong>. </div> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wspu-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wspu-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wspu-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/wspu.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) <div class="source">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="the-future-of-the-empire">The Future of the Empire</h2> <p>By the <strong>late 19th century</strong>, people were debating the future of the <strong>British Empire</strong>.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Supporters</strong> believed it brought <strong>trade and wealth</strong> to Britain.</li> <li> <strong>Critics</strong> said it was <strong>too large</strong> and that frequent <strong>conflicts</strong>, such as those on <strong>India’s northwest frontier</strong> and in <strong>southern Africa</strong>, drained Britain’s <strong>resources</strong>.<br> Still, most British people saw the Empire as a <strong>force for good</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>The <strong>Boer War (1899–1902)</strong> made these debates more serious. Britain fought the <strong>Boers</strong>, Dutch settlers in <strong>South Africa</strong>. The war lasted <strong>over three years</strong> and caused many <strong>deaths</strong> from <strong>battle</strong> and <strong>disease</strong>.<br> Some people began to question whether the Empire could survive.
