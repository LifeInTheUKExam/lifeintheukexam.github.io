These colonies mostly governed themselves. Many colonists had moved there seeking <strong>religious freedom</strong>. They were well educated and cared deeply about <strong>liberty</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>British government</strong> wanted to <strong>tax</strong> the colonies, but the colonists believed this threatened their freedom. They argued for <strong>“no taxation without representation”</strong> in the <strong>British Parliament</strong>. Parliament tried to compromise by removing some taxes, but relations worsened.</p> <p>Fighting broke out between British troops and colonists. In <strong>1776</strong>, <strong>13 American colonies</strong> declared <strong>independence</strong>, saying that people had the right to form their own governments. The colonists defeated the British army, and in <strong>1783</strong>, Britain officially recognised <strong>American independence</strong>.</p> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/join-or-die-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/join-or-die-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/join-or-die-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/join-or-die.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <em>Join, or Die</em> cartoon by Benjamin Franklin, encouraging the American colonies to unite against Britain. <div class="source">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join,_or_Die" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="war-with-france">War with France</h2> <p>During the <strong>18th century</strong>, Britain fought several wars with <strong>France</strong>.

She ruled until <strong>1901</strong>, almost <strong>64 years</strong>. This period is called the <strong>Victorian Age</strong>. Britain grew in <strong>power and influence</strong> around the world.

It became the <strong>largest empire in history</strong>, ruling over <strong>more than 400 million people</strong>.</p> <p>Between <strong>1853 and 1913</strong>, about <strong>13 million</strong> British people moved abroad. At the same time, others came to Britain. Between <strong>1870 and 1914</strong>, around <strong>120,000 Russian and Polish Jews</strong> arrived to escape <strong>persecution</strong>. Many settled in <strong>London’s East End</strong>, <strong>Manchester</strong>, and <strong>Leeds</strong>.

The government supported <strong>free trade</strong>, removing taxes on imports. One example was the <strong>repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846</strong>, which allowed cheap <strong>grain</strong> to be imported. This helped <strong>British industry</strong> grow by reducing costs for raw materials.</p> <p>Working conditions improved slowly. In <strong>1847</strong>, the law limited <strong>women and children</strong> to <strong>10 working hours per day</strong>. Better <strong>housing</strong> was also built for workers.</p> <p><strong>Transport</strong> developed quickly. <strong>George and Robert Stephenson</strong> pioneered the <strong>railway engine</strong>, and railways spread across Britain and the <strong>Empire</strong>. <strong>Isambard Kingdom Brunel</strong> built bridges and designed the <strong>Great Western Railway</strong> from <strong>London Paddington</strong> to <strong>Wales</strong> and the <strong>West Midlands</strong>.</p> <p>By the mid-19th century, Britain produced <strong>over half of the world’s iron, coal, and cotton cloth</strong>, and became a major <strong>financial centre</strong>.</p> <p>In <strong>1851</strong>, the <strong>Great Exhibition</strong> was held in <strong>Hyde Park</strong>, inside the <strong>Crystal Palace</strong>, made of <strong>iron and glass</strong>. It showcased inventions and goods from around the world—most of them made in <strong>Britain</strong>.</p> <div class="knowledge_card"> <h4>Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806–1859)</h4> <div style="margin-top: 5px;"> Born in <strong>Portsmouth</strong>, Brunel was a brilliant <strong>engineer</strong>.
