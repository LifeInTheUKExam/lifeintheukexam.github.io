He tried to make the <strong>Presbyterian Church in Scotland</strong> use it, which caused major unrest.</p> <p>A <strong>Scottish army</strong> was formed. Charles needed money for his army but could not raise it without <strong>Parliamentâ€™s</strong> help. In <strong>1640</strong>, he called Parliament to ask for funds.</p> <p>Many in Parliament were <strong>Puritans</strong> â€” strict Protestants who preferred simple worship. They disagreed with the kingâ€™s religious ideas and reforms. Parliament refused to give him money, even after the <strong>Scottish army invaded England</strong>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a <strong>rebellion in Ireland</strong> began because <strong>Roman Catholics</strong> there feared the growing power of the Puritans. Parliament tried to take control of the <strong>English army</strong>, which would have reduced the kingâ€™s power.</p> <p>Charles reacted by entering the <strong>House of Commons</strong> to arrest <strong>five leaders</strong>, but they had been warned and escaped. (No monarch has entered the Commons since.)<br> Civil war between the king and Parliament began in <strong>1642</strong>.</p> <ul> <li>The kingâ€™s supporters were called the <strong>Cavaliers</strong>.</li> <li>Parliamentâ€™s supporters were called the <strong>Roundheads</strong>.</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/charles-i-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/charles-i-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/charles-i-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/charles-i.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Charles I attempting to arrest five members of Parliament <div class="source">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> </div> </div> <h3 id="oliver-cromwell-and-the-english-republic">Oliver Cromwell and the English Republic</h3> <p>The kingâ€™s army lost the <strong>Battles of Marston Moor</strong> and <strong>Naseby</strong>. By <strong>1646</strong>, Parliament had won, and <strong>Charles I</strong> was captured. He refused to cooperate and was <strong>executed in 1649</strong>.</p> <p>England then became a <strong>republic</strong>, known as the <strong>Commonwealth</strong>, ruled by the <strong>army</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Cromwell</strong>, one of its generals, was sent to <strong>Ireland</strong> to end the rebellion that began in <strong>1641</strong>. He used great <strong>violence</strong>, and his actions still cause debate in Ireland today.</p> <p>The <strong>Scots</strong> did not accept the kingâ€™s execution. They declared <strong>Charles II</strong> as king and crowned him in Scotland. He led a <strong>Scottish army into England</strong>, but Cromwell defeated him at the <strong>Battles of Dunbar</strong> and <strong>Worcester</strong>. Charles II escaped and hid in an <strong>oak tree</strong> before fleeing to <strong>Europe</strong>.</p> <p>After these victories, Cromwell became <strong>Lord Protector</strong> and ruled until <strong>1658</strong>. When he died, his son <strong>Richard Cromwell</strong> took over but could not control the army or government. After 11 years of republican rule, many people wanted stability â€” and a <strong>king</strong> again.</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-restoration">The Restoration</h2> <p>In <strong>May 1660</strong>, Parliament invited <strong>Charles II</strong> to return from exile in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>. He became <strong>King of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland</strong>. Charles promised he would not rule alone again and worked with Parliament.</p> <p>The <strong>Church of England</strong> became the official church once more. <strong>Roman Catholics</strong> and <strong>Puritans</strong> were kept out of power.</p> <p>During his reign:</p> <ul> <li>In <strong>1665</strong>, a terrible <strong>plague</strong> killed thousands in London.</li> <li>In <strong>1666</strong>, the <strong>Great Fire of London</strong> destroyed much of the city, including <strong>St Paulâ€™s Cathedral</strong>.</li> <li> <strong>Sir Christopher Wren</strong> designed the new St Paulâ€™s Cathedral.</li> <li> <strong>Samuel Pepys</strong> described these events in his famous <strong>diary</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>In <strong>1679</strong>, the <strong>Habeas Corpus Act</strong> was passed. This law said that no one could be imprisoned unlawfully and that everyone had a right to a <strong>court hearing</strong>.</p> <p>Charles II also encouraged <strong>science</strong>. The <strong>Royal Society</strong>, the worldâ€™s oldest surviving scientific society, was founded during his reign. Its early members included <strong>Sir Edmund Halley</strong>, who predicted <strong>Halleyâ€™s Comet</strong>, and <strong>Sir Isaac Newton</strong>, one of historyâ€™s greatest scientists.</p> <div class="knowledge_card"> <h4>Isaac Newton (1643â€“1727)</h4> <div style="margin-top: 5px;"> Born in <strong>Lincolnshire</strong>, Newton studied at <strong>Cambridge University</strong>. His most famous book, <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, explained <strong>gravity</strong> and how it applied to the whole universe. He also discovered that <strong>white light</strong> is made up of all the <strong>colours of the rainbow</strong>. His discoveries are still vital to modern science. <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/newton-prism.webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/newton-prism.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Isaac Newton's experiments with light and prisms <div class="source">Source: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/refraction-is-then-all-there-is-to-it-how-isaac-newtons-experiments-revealed-the-mystery-of-light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Science</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="a-catholic-king">A Catholic King</h2> <p><strong>Charles II</strong> had no legitimate children. He died in <strong>1685</strong>, and his brother became <strong>King James II</strong> (or <strong>James VII</strong> in Scotland).</p> <p>James was <strong>Roman Catholic</strong> and allowed Catholics to be army officers, which <strong>Parliament</strong> had banned. He did not cooperate with Parliament and even <strong>arrested Church of England bishops</strong>.</p> <p>People feared that he wanted to make England <strong>Catholic</strong> again. His heirs were <strong>two Protestant daughters</strong>, but when his wife had a <strong>son</strong>, it seemed the next monarch would be <strong>Catholic</strong>.</p> <h2 id="the-glorious-revolution">The Glorious Revolution</h2> <p>Jamesâ€™s elder daughter <strong>Mary</strong> was married to <strong>William of Orange</strong>, the <strong>Protestant ruler of the Netherlands</strong>.</p> <p>In <strong>1688</strong>, leading Protestants invited <strong>William</strong> to invade England and become king. When he arrived, there was <strong>no resistance</strong>. <strong>James II fled to France</strong>, and William became <strong>William III</strong> (and <strong>William II of Scotland</strong>) ruling jointly with <strong>Mary</strong>.</p> <p>This peaceful change was called the <strong>Glorious Revolution</strong>. It secured the <strong>power of Parliament</strong> and ended the danger of a monarch ruling alone.</p> <p>James tried to reclaim the throne with a <strong>French army</strong> but was defeated by William at the <strong>Battle of the Boyne</strong> in <strong>1690</strong>. This victory is still celebrated by some in <strong>Northern Ireland</strong>.</p> <p>James fled to France, and <strong>Irish Catholics</strong> lost many rights, including participation in government.</p> <p>In <strong>Scotland</strong>, there was a short <strong>Jacobite rebellion</strong> defeated at <strong>Killiecrankie</strong>. All <strong>Scottish clans</strong> had to swear loyalty to William. The <strong>MacDonalds of Glencoe</strong> were late and were killed â€” a massacre still remembered with anger.</p> <p>Jamesâ€™s supporters, known as <strong>Jacobites</strong>, continued to believe he was the rightful king. Some followed him into exile in France; others supported him secretly.</p> <hr> <blockquote> <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Charles Iâ€™s reforms</strong> caused unrest in <strong>Scotland</strong> and <strong>Ireland</strong>.</li> <li>The <strong>English Civil War (1642â€“1646)</strong> divided <strong>Cavaliers</strong> and <strong>Roundheads</strong>.</li> <li> <strong>Charles I was executed</strong>; England became a <strong>republic</strong> under <strong>Oliver Cromwell</strong>.</li> <li>Cromwell ruled as <strong>Lord Protector</strong> until <strong>1658</strong>; his son <strong>Richard</strong> failed to lead.</li> <li>The <strong>monarchy was restored in 1660</strong> with <strong>Charles II</strong>.</li> <li>London suffered the <strong>1665 plague</strong> and <strong>1666 Great Fire</strong>.</li> <li>The <strong>Habeas Corpus Act (1679)</strong> protected against <strong>unlawful imprisonment</strong>.</li> <li>The <strong>Royal Society</strong> promoted science; <strong>Newton</strong> made major discoveries.</li> <li> <strong>James II (1685)</strong> tried to promote <strong>Catholicism</strong>, causing unrest.</li> <li>The <strong>Glorious Revolution (1688)</strong> brought <strong>William III</strong> and <strong>Mary</strong> to power.</li> <li>The <strong>Battle of the Boyne (1690)</strong> confirmed <strong>Williamâ€™s rule</strong>.</li> <li> <strong>Jacobites</strong> continued to support <strong>James IIâ€™s cause</strong>.</li> </ul> </blockquote> </article> <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; min-height: 10vh; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 1em;"> <span>Ready to challenge yourself on this chapter ?</span> <a href="/quiz?topic=the-english-civil-war-and-the-glorious-revolution" aria-label="Start Quiz for The English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution" style="text-decoration: none;"> <button type="submit" class="newsletter-form-button" style="justify-content: center;"> Start Quiz </button> </a> </div> <script>
